## How can I deploy this project?

Simply open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/42a9c31a-1c78-4a72-8d23-19d3f15ebb8a) and click on Share -> Publish.

### GitHub Pages

This project is GH Pagesâ€“ready. A workflow is included to build and deploy to the gh-pages branch.

- The site will be available at: https://<your-github-username>.github.io/warframe-FE/
- API configuration on GH Pages (static hosting):
  - Status: VITE_STATUS_URL is set to https://yukieevee-warframe.koyeb.app/prime/status
  - Drop search: VITE_API_BASE is set to https://yukieevee-warframe.koyeb.app (the app posts to <base>/drop/search)
- Asset base path: VITE_BASE_PATH=/warframe-FE/ is used so assets load correctly under the repo path.
- SPA routing: The workflow copies dist/index.html to dist/404.html so client-side routes work on refresh.

To enable:
1. Push to main. The workflow .github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml will build and deploy automatically.
2. In your GitHub repo settings, go to Pages and set Source = GitHub Actions.

If your repository name changes, update VITE_BASE_PATH accordingly in the workflow.

### Docker deployment (self-host)

This repo includes a Dockerfile to build and serve the app with Nginx, including a production proxy for API calls.

Build the image:

```sh
docker build -t warframe-FE .
# Optionally bake the API status URL at build time (used by the app when fetching prime status):
# docker build --build-arg VITE_STATUS_URL=https://yukieevee-warframe.koyeb.app/prime/status -t warframe-FE .
```

Run the container:

```sh
docker run -d --name warframe-fe -p 8080:80 warframe-FE
```

- The app will be available at http://localhost:8080
- The container proxies the following to https://yukieevee-warframe.koyeb.app:
  - /api/prime -> /prime
  - /api/drop -> /drop
- For the prime status, you can also set VITE_STATUS_URL at build time (see above). If not set, the app will use the on-container proxy at /api/prime/status.
