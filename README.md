# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## How can I deploy this project?

### GitHub Pages

This project is GH Pagesâ€“ready. A workflow is included to build and deploy to the gh-pages branch.

- The site will be available at: https://<your-github-username>.github.io/warframe-FE/
- Asset base path: VITE_BASE_PATH=/warframe-FE/ is used so assets load correctly under the repo path.
- SPA routing: The workflow copies dist/index.html to dist/404.html so client-side routes work on refresh.
- API calls use a single fixed base: https://yukieevee-warframe.koyeb.app (GET /prime/status, POST /drop/search).

To enable:
1. Push to main. The workflow .github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml will build and deploy automatically.
2. In your GitHub repo settings, go to Pages and set Source = GitHub Actions.

If your repository name changes, update VITE_BASE_PATH accordingly in the workflow.

#### Preventing white-screen regressions on GitHub Pages

White pages usually come from incorrect base path or routing config after a change. This repo includes guards:

- Build-time base tag in index.html: `<base href="%BASE_URL%" />` so assets resolve under the repo subpath.
- Router basename normalization in `src/utils/base.ts` used by `BrowserRouter`.
- CI verification workflow `.github/workflows/verify-gh-pages.yml` that builds with `VITE_BASE_PATH=/warframe-FE/` and runs `scripts/verify-gh-pages.mjs` to ensure `dist/index.html` contains the correct `<base>` and asset URLs.

Run locally before pushing:

```sh
# build with GH Pages base and verify
npm run build:pages && VITE_BASE_PATH=/warframe-FE/ npm run test:pages
```

If you rename the repository, change `/warframe-FE/` in:
- `.github/workflows/deploy-gh-pages.yml`
- `.github/workflows/verify-gh-pages.yml`
- `package.json` script `build:pages`
- Any docs/commands referencing the base path.

### Docker deployment (self-host)

This repo includes a Dockerfile to build and serve the app with Nginx, including a production proxy for API calls.

Build the image:

```sh
docker build -t warframe-FE .
# Optionally bake the API status URL at build time (used by the app when fetching prime status):
# docker build --build-arg VITE_STATUS_URL=https://yukieevee-warframe.koyeb.app/prime/status -t warframe-FE .
```

Run the container:

```sh
docker run -d --name warframe-fe -p 8080:80 warframe-FE
```

- The app will be available at http://localhost:8080
- The app calls the backend directly at https://yukieevee-warframe.koyeb.app (no internal proxy).
